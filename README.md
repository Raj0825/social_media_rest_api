# Social Media REST API (Spring Boot)

A basic **Social Media REST API** built using **Spring Boot** to demonstrate core backend concepts such as RESTful endpoints, HTTP methods, request/response handling, and in-memory data management.

This project is intentionally kept simple to focus on **REST fundamentals** before introducing databases and advanced features.

## 🚀 Features Implemented

* Retrieve all users
* Retrieve a single user by ID
* Create a new user using POST request

## ▶️ How to Run the Project

1. Clone the repository

   ```bash
   git clone <(https://github.com/Raj0825/social_media_rest_api)>
   ```
2. Open the project in IntelliJ IDEA
3. Run the main Spring Boot application
4. Server starts on:

   ```
   http://localhost:8080
   ```
5. Test APIs using **Postman**



## 🧪 Testing the API

* Browser → Only for GET requests
* Postman → Required for POST requests

Make sure to set:

```
Content-Type: application/json
```


## ⚠️ Important Notes

* This project uses **in-memory storage**, data resets on restart
* No database integration yet (planned improvement)
* Exception handling and validation will be added later


## 📈 Future Improvements

* Proper 404 error handling
* Input validation
* DELETE and UPDATE endpoints
* Database integration (JPA + H2/MySQL)
* Pagination & filtering
